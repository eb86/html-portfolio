<h2>Elaine's Top 3 movie picks.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p>This movie is what made me more interested in reading. I saw this movie when I was young so it reminds me of the only times in my younger years when I could escape my toxic world.</p>
<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>Pan's Labyrinth is probably one of the best movies made about lores. It has fantasy element. It has horror element. It has thriller element. It has social and family element. I can't wait until my daughters are old enough to watch this.</p>
<h3>Legally Blonde</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love Elle Woods? She's so inspiring! She broke the stereotype of girly-girls being bimbos. She made it known to everyone that you can be pretty, and reasonably vain, and into fashion, while taking on a whole room full of intelligent (sometimes arrogant and judgmental) people, and prove that you belong there. All in high heels!</p>
